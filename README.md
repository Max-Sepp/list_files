# List Files
This is a project I develop because I needed the ability to have the code of a project to be put into a format that I can add to an appendix of a report.

## Installation
To install clone the git repo and then run:
```
cargo install --path .
```
This just compiles and installs the project on your system. To use type listfiles in a terminal and it will output the contents of everything in that directory.
